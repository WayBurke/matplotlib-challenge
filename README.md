# MODULE 5 CHALLENGE - Matplotlib Pymaceuticals

## Performance of the Capomilin drug against other treatment regimens

### Overview
The purpose of this report is to compare the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals, Inc. drug Capomulin for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) against other treatment programs. The clinical trial, that lasted over 45 days, collected data for 249 mice with SCC tumors who received treatment with a range of drug programs. Data on the tumor development were recorded and the findings can be found this report. 


### Observations and Insights 

The following are the key insights observed from this an
* The sex of the mice were evenly distributed and there is no bias to be assumed on that basis
* The outliers identified from the top 4 Drug Regimen did not change the results and can be dropped from the dataset. Since the SEM for the drugs analyzed were low, we can determine that the we have a good representation of the population
* Drug Regimen - Capomulin showed a significant decrease in the volume of the tumor as was demonstrated with Mouse "b128"
